# LLM Comparision tool
- Designed a Web Application on for comparing responses of different LLMs to a given prompt.
- Created the frontend using Streamlit to allow users to input API details of LLM and prompts. The page then displays the
received response in a column-wise format.
- Developed the Backend that returns the response for the selected LLM.
